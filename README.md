# Fake Job Classification Model

This project aims to build a machine learning model that identifies fraudulent job postings. By analyzing various features from job listings, the model predicts whether a job posting is fake or legitimate. The project involves data exploration, preprocessing, and the development of classification models to achieve accurate predictions.

## Project Overview

Fake job postings are a common issue on job platforms, posing risks to job seekers. This project builds a classification model using machine learning techniques to detect such postings, providing insights into the features that commonly distinguish fraudulent job ads.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains various attributes of job postings, including job titles, locations, descriptions, and other relevant information. Key steps include:

- Data loading and initial exploration to understand the distribution of fraudulent job listings.
- Handling missing values and other preprocessing tasks to clean and prepare the data for modeling.

## Features

- **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Visualizing the data to understand patterns and distributions, focusing on fraudulent job characteristics.
- **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values, removing unnecessary columns, and preparing the data for analysis.
- **Model Training**: Building classification models using different machine learning algorithms to detect fraudulent postings.
- **Evaluation**: Measuring the performance of the models using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

## Installation

To run the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/fake-job-classification.git
   cd fake-job-classification
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   Ensure `numpy`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, and other libraries required for model training are installed.

## Usage

1. Load the dataset by running the initial cells of the notebook.
2. Explore the data using the provided EDA steps.
3. Preprocess the data by handling missing values and preparing features.
4. Train the classification model using the provided training scripts.
5. Evaluate the modelâ€™s performance using the evaluation metrics provided.

## Results

The model's performance will be evaluated using key metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. Visualizations will help interpret the effectiveness of the classification approach in distinguishing fake job listings.
